# Installing <!-- {{ product }} --> on Ubuntu

The recommended way to install <!-- {{ product }} --> is to use prebuilt packages from our official release repository.
If the repository is not configured yet,
please [add](#adding-icinga-package-repository) it first
before [installing](#installing-the-package) the package.

All packages we provide are signed with the following [key](https://packages.icinga.com/icinga.key).

## Adding Icinga Package Repository

Hereâ€™s how to add the official release repository:

```bash
apt-get update
apt-get -y install apt-transport-https wget gnupg

wget -O - https://packages.icinga.com/icinga.key | apt-key add -

. /etc/os-release; if [ ! -z ${UBUNTU_CODENAME+x} ]; then DIST="${UBUNTU_CODENAME}"; else DIST="$(lsb_release -c| awk '{print $2}')"; fi; \
 echo "deb https://packages.icinga.com/ubuntu icinga-${DIST} main" > \
 /etc/apt/sources.list.d/${DIST}-icinga.list
 echo "deb-src https://packages.icinga.com/ubuntu icinga-${DIST} main" >> \
 /etc/apt/sources.list.d/${DIST}-icinga.list

apt-get update
```
