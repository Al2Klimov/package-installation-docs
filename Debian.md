# Installing {{ product }} on Debian

The recommended way to install {{ product }} is to use prebuilt packages from our official release repository.
If the repository is not configured yet,
please [add](#adding-icinga-package-repository) it first
before [installing](#installing-the-package) the package.

All packages we provide are signed with the following [key](https://packages.icinga.com/icinga.key).

## Adding Icinga Package Repository

Hereâ€™s how to add the official release repository:

```bash
apt-get update
apt-get -y install apt-transport-https wget gnupg

wget -O - https://packages.icinga.com/icinga.key | apt-key add -

DIST=$(awk -F"[)(]+" '/VERSION=/ {print $2}' /etc/os-release); \
 echo "deb https://packages.icinga.com/debian icinga-${DIST} main" > \
 /etc/apt/sources.list.d/${DIST}-icinga.list
 echo "deb-src https://packages.icinga.com/debian icinga-${DIST} main" >> \
 /etc/apt/sources.list.d/${DIST}-icinga.list

apt-get update
```

## Installing the Package

Use your distribution's package manager to install the `{{ package }}` package as follows:

```bash
apt-get install {{ package }}
```
